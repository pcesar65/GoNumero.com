<p><small>People usually get discouraged at the gym when they see no improvements whatsoever. These factors can be lack of sleep, vitamins, protein, carbs, fat intake or even your workout program. If you don’t eat enough, your body can’t use calories for repair and growth.  As a rule of thumb, weight loss is generally 75 percent diet and 25 percent exercise. </small></p>

<p><small>In recent years, much attention has been paid to the search of natural substances in foods that can be
beneficial to the human body in preventing or treating one or more diseases or improving its physiological
performance.This research has been taken from the University of California Database and UCSB athletes. These are our recommendations for a faster and healthier aesthetic body. </small></p>

## Creatine Monohydrate 

<p><small>Creatine (N-[aminoiminomethyl]-N-methyl glycine, Cr) is a nonessential dietary element
found in high abundance in meat and fish. Currently, Cr is widely used as an ergogenic nutritional supplement
by athletes, and it is well tolerated in this specic sector of consumers. It has been estimated that
more than one-third of athletes regularly use Cr to improve muscular performance. On the other hand,
recent  findings have indicated that Cr supplementation has a therapeutic role in preventing several diseases
characterized by atrophic conditions, weakness, and metabolic disturbances. Thus, Cr is an emerging
nutritional supplement used not only by athletes, but also by elderly people as well as aged patients
presenting different diseases. </small></p>

<b>Note:</b>
><p><small>The ingestion of Cr together with other food supplements can promote and enhance its effect as ergogenic dietary complement. It has been described that the ingestion of carbohydrate with Cr enhances intramuscular Cr uptake and glycogen deposition (Green et¡al. 1996a,b),whereas ingestion of glucose and sodium with Cr would theoretically provide additional ergogenic effect. </small></p>


<p><small> Supplementation of creatine monohydrate in the diet increases Cr and PCr cellular levels in muscle tissue enhancing muscular strength. The most obvious effects of Cr are observed after several weeks of supplementation in combination with a resistance exercise program.(6/g a day)</small></p>

## L-Citrulline DL-Malete 2:1 
<p><small> Citrulline Malete is the supplemental form of the non-essential amino acid citrulline. Non-essential doesn't mean this amino acid is pointless, it simply means that your body creates it naturally. The main reasons why people supplement with L-citrulline are improving heart health, blood flow, endurance, boosting muscle growth and recovery. Research shows that that supplementing your workouts and training with L-Citrulline Malate form can improve your performance and recovery. Below are some key bullet points on the effects of L-Cit </small></p>

+ <small> Improved circulation   </small>
+ <small> Bigger "pumps" (Increase Bicep Vascularity)  </small>
+ <small> More muscle endurance   </small>
+ <small> Higher energy in your workouts and less fatigue   </small>
+ <small> Decrease muscle soreness   </small>

<small> Citrulline helps boosts nitric-oxide levels, which can help dilate your blood vessels, allowing more oxygen and nutrients to be delievedto your muscles.

<small>Malate serves as an important component in the tricarboxylic cycle which is one way your body produces fuel. When you increase malate levels, you increase energy production. Therefore, citrulline malate brings additional blood—and subsequently, oxygen and nutrients—to exercising muscles, as well as providing increased energy to boost performance levels. According to bodybuilding.com and European Journal of Sport Science states that consuming 8 grams of citrulline malate before exercise resulted in increased maximal grip strength and improved lower-body explosive power.[5]</small>

## L-Carnitine 

<small> This is not a recommendation but I usually like putting this on my top list since L-carnitine is necessary for fat burning. This supplement only helps elderly or people that don’t eat meat. </small>

<small>Supplementation with L-carnitine has directly improved muscle growth is in the elderly and that was due to correcting a deficiency. Thus, it’s safe to assume that we wouldn’t see the same effects in those of us with normal carnitine levels.</small>

<div id="amzn-assoc-ad-f30b4ef0-2205-43e9-89cf-7fbc78018b1e"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=f30b4ef0-2205-43e9-89cf-7fbc78018b1e"></script>

<small>Last but not least, L-carnitine has been show to reduce both mental and physical fatigue during exercise in the elderly, but not in young, healthy people.[6]</small> 

+ <small>L-carnitine probably isn’t going to improve your exercise performance. </small>

## Beta Alanine 

<small>Beta Alanine is one of my favorite pre-workout supplements with L-Citrulline. Its a non-essential amino acid that is produced naturally in the body. <b>Your body uses beta-alanine to synthesize another amino acid called carnosine</b>. That's a compound that plays a role in muscle endurance in high-intensity.</small>


  <img src="http://muaythaipros.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/beta-alanine.jpg" style="width:300px;height:200px;margin-right:10px;float: right;">
 <b> How does Beta Alanine work?</b>

<small>While exercising, muscle contracts causing  acid accumulating the build-up of acid impairs the ability of your muscles to keep contracting and causing you to end your training set. Carnosine serves as an acid buffer and helps counteract this acid build up, which increases the amount of work your muscles can do before they become fatigued.[7] In order to increase carnosine in your muscles you need Beta-alanine.</small>
  
 <div id="amzn-assoc-ad-fe05528c-3d49-46dc-a8a9-336378252f6e"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=fe05528c-3d49-46dc-a8a9-336378252f6e"></script>

<small>Intense workouts without the adequate amounts of non-essential amino acid can't produce carnosine efficiently and you are limited to a slow time recovery and less gains. </small>
> <small> research has shown that supplementation with beta-alanine is incredibly effective for increasing muscle carnosine levels.[8]</small>

+ <small>Greater Endurance </small>
+ <small>Increase Strength </small>
+ <small>Supports Muscle Growth </small>

<b>Side Effets: </b>
<small> When consumed, you get paresthesia (tingles) usually the first time you take it similar to pre-workout. That's because Beta-Alanine is one of the few proven commodities in pre-workout supplements that deliver fast results. Next time you buy pre-workout check the ingredients.</small>

## Whey Protein Isolate 
<small> Whey proteins are highly bioavailable, are very quickly absorbed into the body, and have a high concentration of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) which are highly concentrated in muscle tissue, and are used to fuel working muscles and stimulate protein synthesis.[9]</small>
<small>Whey protein isolate undergoes more processing compare to concentrate, which results in a higher protein content with less carbs, lactose and fat. Isolate is typically more expensive than whey concentrate.</small>

<div id="amzn-assoc-ad-fa19bfe7-9e28-441e-b7f2-0939aa944c59"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=fa19bfe7-9e28-441e-b7f2-0939aa944c59"></script>

<small> I can't give a recommendation because all whey proteins are different. Depending on your purpose of diet, carb intake and/or muscle growth you will choose between whey protein concentrate or Isolate. 

+ <small>May Help Reduce Hunger </small>
+ <small>Excellent source of branched-chain amino acids </small>
+ <small>Boosts The Effects Of Resistance Training </small>

<small>No matter if your goal is to increase muscle, reduce body fat, or control hunger, whey can help and its the #1 choice for all body builders.</small>
