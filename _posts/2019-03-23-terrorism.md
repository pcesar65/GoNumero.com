 <b>Indroduction</b>

<small> Within contemporary politics, mainstream media sources focus on the current rise of Islamic terrorism which has affected the majority of the world but tend to ignore other ideologies utilized by active terrorist or attempt to employ differing criminal designations such as hate crimes and workplace violence. Virtually all established societies have either been a victim or have perpetrated some form of terrorism against their foes to instill fear or coerce a source of authority. While terrorism is rare in any singular location, its occurrence appears to affect the world. This effect can be attributed to how globalized and interconnected the people have become in recent years. Incidents such as the 2001 September 11th attacks and the 2015 Paris attacks demonstrate how the world is affected and how citizens of the world rally in support after a terrorist attack. Yet, attacks resulting in mass casualties we can observe the popularity of terrorist organizations diminish due to excessive brutality. Nevertheless, terrorist attacks, in particular lone wolf attacks, continue to occur, so it is imperative to identify patterns in terrorist behavior, the motives which drive individuals to radicalization, and how to halt terrorist efforts to make society safer. No two locations are similar however, hence this paper the different types and ideologies of terrorist cells will be examined in the United States and Europe. While these regions are not the only recipients of terrorist attacks, these regions have more tools to tackle the issues which are presented in combating terrorism. </small>

<b>DEFINITION OF TERRORISM</b>

<small> To begin with, the definition of a terrorist act needs to be universally defined. Some attacks that classify as terrorism in Europe do not classify as terrorist attacks in the United States. It is difficult to point out what a proper definition of terrorism is as there is no universally accepted definition of the term, not by the United Nations or the European Union. In addition, within the government of the United States exists several definitions of terrorism throughout many of the different agencies and departments. For simplicity, the most common terms will be used as a definition to represent the different regions, drawing from the European Union Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on combating terrorism (2002/475/JHA) as acts committed with the aim of ‘seriously intimidating a population’, ‘unduly compelling a government or international organization to perform or abstain from performing any act’ or ‘seriously destabilizing or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economics or social structures of a country or an international organization’” (Pawlak, 2015). As aforementioned, the United States carries multiple definitions at different levels of government. First, the United States Code definition, serves as the highest description of how to classify such attacks, which states terrorism is premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents” (22 U.S. Code 38 §2656f, 2000). Another definition which is relevant and adds a crucial element is the Code of Federal Regulations version which states terrorism is the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives” (28 C.F.R. Section 0.85). In order to properly gauge how to evaluate terrorist acts and organizations, the commonalities need to be extracted and made into a comprehensive definition. First is intimidation or coercion of the population or government institution, and second is attacks on the civilian population although, only the United States Code mentions non-combatants or what is commonly thought of as a civilian population, and finally, the objective of achieving political, economic or social aims, such as destabilization as the Council of the European Union states it. Using these three central motivations as characteristics necessary to define an attack as terrorism is integral to properly comparing the United States to Europe. Furthermore, a terrorist organization shall be defined as a group with 2 or more individuals who seek to intentionally perpetrate or promote any action which may be defined as a terrorist act, this definition stems from the Council of the European Union under the framework decision as above (2002/475/JHA).

<b>DANGERS OF AMBIGUITY IN THE DEFINITION OF TERRORISM</b>

<small> The definition of terrorism is very important within a legal standpoint due to the ramifications should one associate with perceived terrorist organizations. The constantly fluctuating definition of terrorism causes certain terrorist events to incorrectly be label, either correctly or incorrectly. By extension, the constant flux can be observed as a political move to silence or discredit opposing groups. As an example, in the United States during the 1980's attacks toward abortion clinics or supporters, the conservative leaning government did not label these attacks terrorism despite its clear intentions to instill fear due the support of conservative lawmakers who sympathized with the movement. Due to an ideological shift during the Clinton administration in 1992 to progressive liberal this violence was justly labeled terrorism (Jenkins,1999, p.112). Nevertheless, groups who are found to be terrorist organizations, both domestically and internationally face legal pressure and permanent degradation of their name. </small>

<small>As according to the United States Department of State, once an organization is designated as a terror network it becomes a federal offense, punishable by a fine and/or a sentence of less than 20 years in prison, to aid these groups with material or monetary support. More severely, if the terror network has committed atrocities which result in death, the sentence then becomes up to life in prison (18 U.S. Code § 2339B(a)(1)). Consequently those who are found to be representatives or active members of designated foreign terrorist organizations can be removed from the United States and denied entry (8 U.S.C. §§ 1182 (a)(3)(B)(i)(IV)-(V))(8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(1)(A)). </small>

<small>Socially, the effects of receiving a foreign terrorist organization label are extensive as well. One an organization receives the label it falls out of public support and will more than likely experience a decrease in membership and support. Merely receiving this label, even if mislabeled, completely shatters the reputation of said groups and will likely never reach same popularity as prior thank to the negative stigmata the association of terrorism carries. Legally, the designation of terrorist activities carries heavier penalties in the court room or even the complete removal of due process. Classifying someone as a terrorist authorizes authorities to utilize otherwise illegal practices without the expressed need of a warrant. Hence, it is easy to see why a conducive definition of terrorism needs to be universally accepted due to the ramifications the label holds. </small>

<b> BRIEF HISTORY OF TERRORISM </b>

<small> Formally, the term terrorism or terror, in the fashion used today was coined due to the 1789 French Revolution following the successful overthrow and killing of King Louis XVI. The new revolutionary government under the direction of Maximilian Robespierre formed the Committee of Public Safety and the Revolutionary Tribunal. After these agencies were established the so called "regime de la terreur", Reign of Terror, began. Mass surveillance and frequent public executions became the norm in new post-revolution France with an estimated 17,000 to 40,000 people falling victim to the senseless violence (Mahan & Griset, 2003). However, this form of terrorism is unlike what people may see now, this terrorism was perpetrated by the government. This phenomenon is referred to as State-Terrorism, State Sponsored Terrorism or Terrorism from Above; the goals remain the same as all terrorism, instill terror in political dissidents to silence opposition and push an agenda.
However, by no means did the French create terrorism, terrorism had been a tool in previous civilizations as a means to change regimes or gain freedom. One of the earliest examples stems from the Jewish Zealots or Sicarii, this group was a religious group with interest in protecting the religion from the Roman rule in Judea, modern day Israel. Their motives spanned a more inclusive goal, however, to free Judea of Roman rule, their attacks, which utilized daggers as a religious symbol, targeted Roman peace envoys, Roman Garrisons and other Roman targets. The ultimate goal of the Zealots were to generate an uprising within the Jewish community to drive away the Romans, to generate support the Zealots manipulated and utilized the fear, outrage, sympathy and guilt of participates to commit atrocities (Rapoport, 1983). Other early forms of organized terrorist organizations including the Muslim Assassins, Hindi Thugs, Russian Narodnaya Volya, the Irish Republican Army, etc... </small>

<b> "OLD TERRORISM" </b>

<small> Old terrorism is used by scholars to define pre-1990's terrorism which appears to follow a different set of standards to that of current New Terrorism. Old Terrorism is thought to be discriminate with small calculated attacks, such as assassinations, to achieve their goal. Groups utilizing old terrorism would use attacks sparingly to not inflict much damage and tried to prevent accidental damage altogether. The fear of using indiscriminate attacks would stifle recruitment, public support and their legitimacy. Terrorism can be seen as propaganda as terrorist attacks would rely heavily on media coverage to spread their message, especially since most old modern terrorist attacks would be followed communique to claim responsibility, stating demands, and explain the reasoning for the attack. Such was the case with the Spanish ETA which routinely communicate their intentions (Spencer, 2010). </small>

<small>Central to the belief of old and new terrorism is the ideology/goals which supports the goal. Old terrorism is thought to have achievable and negotiable goals, such as secession from host countries and demands of civil rights (Spencer, 2010). An example can be seen with the Irish Republican Army's (IRA) efforts to break free from the United Kingdom. Seeking independence, the IRA targeted English targets in Ireland and in mainland Britain, including Irish supporters of British occupation. In the end, a settlement was reach where the majority of Ireland was given its independence, minus the northern portion. The IRA was not exactly content with this separation and continued to fight. </small>

<small>Another belief of old terrorism is the type of organizational structure utilized by the groups themselves. Groups such as the IRA, ETA, KKK, pre-2000's al-Qaeda and Aum Shinrikyo utilize a hierarchical organizations structure with strong well-defined leadership. Perhaps, the most well-known example is pre-2000's al-Qaeda, founded by Osama Bin Laden, followed a very rigid structure headed by the Amir, which for the majority of the groups operation was Osama Bin Laden. The Amir also employed the use of Secretary which would control all the administrative work behind the scenes, this role was played by Nassir Al Wahishi. Next in the chain was the Deputy which contained more authority than the Amir. The role of Deputy fell onto Ayman al-Zawahiri who is currently the Amir of al-Qaeda. Next comes the Command Council, a body of 7-10 members who are tasked with making most of the decisions within al-Qaeda's operations (Gunaratna, Oreg, 2010). Strikingly the structure can be loosely interchanged with that of a working government, such that of the United States Executive Branch with rules similar to that of a government on normal operation and the filling of vacancies. </small>

<small> Another characteristic among terror organization utilizing old terrorism is the use of conventional weapons. Conventional weapons are low-technology weapons which have low mass killing potential but are readily available. These weapons include small arms, such as handheld firearms including but not limited to handguns, revolvers, rifles, machine guns and rocket launchers, and bombs, such as handheld grenades, pipe bombs, pressure cookers and plastic explosives. Conventional weapons do not utilize weapons of mass destruction (WMD), WMD's are classified as nuclear bombs, chemical weapons and biological weapons (Spencer, 2010;18U.S.C.§2332a). </small>

<b>"NEW TERRORISM"</b>

<small>The existence of new terrorism is hotly debated among academia with proponents stating terrorist organizations have undergone a massive organizational shift and have become more radical in ideology. Dissenting opinions have stated that terror networks are not utilizing any new tactics or methods of attack relative to their historical counterparts.</small>

<small>Scholars allege the existence of new terrorism due to the recent increase in the use of religion as justifications for violence. Within old terrorism most of the groups were secular, focusing mostly on social, economic, and political causes (Crenshaw, 2008: Spencer, 2010). As noted earlier old terrorist groups such as the IRA fought for secession from the United Kingdom, most major new terrorist groups focus on a religious justification, such as al-Qaeda, Islamic State, the Taliban, Ansar Allah, etc. However, not all terrorist organizations fall under this categorization in contemporary politics. Right Wing groups in the United States and Europe, while based in Christian, Protestant or Evangelical beliefs, are conducting terrorism in the name of perceived violation of civil rights, economic grievance, and increases in multiculturalism.</small>

<small> New Terrorist group who utilize religious motivations are claimed to employ increasing violent attacks. This is due to the belief that the extremist are not concerned with alienating their supporters but rather see themselves as workers of a higher power (Spencer, 2010). Examples can be seen with new Islamic terrorist groups in the Arabian Peninsula. ISIS, or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, originated as a splinter group from al-Qaeda in 2013, who refused al-Qaeda's direction to not directly target Muslim. Serving as extreme form of Islamic purism, ISIS had the goal of creating an Islamic Caliphate where Sharia Law is implemented as government. One of the missions of ISIS is the demise of Western influence, as such the group had attacked Europe and North America on numerous occasions claiming more than 1000 lives over the group 5 year history. Their most brutal attacks come out of non-western nations against other Muslims, attacking Mosque which supported the Shia interpretation of Islam. The brutal attacks in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Egypt, Yemen, Iran and Syria would often times claim more than 50 lives. This caused ISIS to fall out of support of most Muslims. Indiscriminate violence has also been linked with New terrorism as groups are conducting violence without regard of who is affected by the resulting destruction (Spencer, 2010). This can be seen with ISIS, as noted previously, originally being a splinter of al-Qaeda was restricted by Islamic law from killing other Muslims. Zawahiri of al-Qaeda also urged al-Qaeda in Iraq (ISIS) to kill less civilians and non-combatants to preserve the groups public appeal. Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi refused and their partner came to an end, ISIS would then go one perform some of the worse terror attacks perpetrated across the world. </small>

<small> New terrorist groups also tend to hold very extremist end goals, which can be thought to be unattainable and unrealistic. In old terrorism the groups were able to negotiate with authorities to get their demands fulfilled, new terrorist are quite the opposite and do not wish to negotiate nor could they (Crenshaw, 2007). Due to the assertion that new terrorist follow a religious sense of justification for violence, the groups portray themselves in a good vs evil battle, the complete eradication of those perceived to be bad is the end goal (Spencer. 2010).</small>

<small> New terrorism also alleges new terrorist utilize more advanced technology as it becomes available, in particular WMD's, as weapons (Spencer, 2006; Crenshaw, 2008; Gunaratna, 2010; Spencer, 2010). There have been no terrorist organizations capable of obtaining usable nuclear weapons, however, the scare came about after the fall of the Soviet Union. Several nuclear bombs were lost due to the chaos associated with the collapse. All of the bombs have been largely recollected but the scare has extended to all governments which have the capability to mobilize nuclear weapons. The most of high tech attacks have included chemical and biological attacks as it materials tend to be easier to obtain. While these attacks are rare, the result of these attacks tend to bring more deaths than conventional weapons. An example of chemical attacks is the 1995 Tokyo Subway Sarin Attack perpetrated by members of Aum Shinrikyo in Japan. However, the production of the Serin gas had been rushed resulting in the gas being less potent. Should the gas had been produced correctly it could have resulted in thousands of deaths rather than the 12 it did, thus showing the destructive capability. </small>

<small> Another aspect of new terrorism is the lack of hierarchical organizational structure and the lack of the central leaderships control. These organizations are more likely to follow a network structure which advocates for a numerous cells which operate under similar guidelines but do not directly follow the commands of the central wing (Spencer, 2006; Spencer, 2010). This method of organizational structure came to be with the advent of social media and encrypted messaging platforms. Social media has served as a medium for which radical ideas are shared, allowing extremist to develop worldwide as lone wolfs or splinter groups. The main group has little or no direction over the individual or group, but the attack will reflect the terrorist organization as a whole. </small>

<b> SUMMARY </b>

<small> Terrorism seeks to gain political leverage by means of violent attack, with or without bodily harm. Destruction to landmarks, infrastructure and, most importantly, people should not be tolerated by any civilization, terrorism is not an inherently successful method of coercion. Ganor states that "one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter" (Ganor, 2002), a sentiment continued by Hoffman was observed members of terrorist organizations see themselves as freedom fighters, armies, militias, self-defense movements or liberators rather than inflictors of violence (Hoffman, 2006). Yet, despite the use of violence, terror groups see support from states and civilian populations should their interest align. </small>

<small> Acts of terrorism will be seen for the rest of human history, regardless of the motives, as a means of political coercion or means to incite widespread fear. Counterterrorism efforts need to evolve with terrorist acts to aid in identification of at-risk suspects and prevention of attacks. While counterterrorism is largely oriented to a governmental and law enforcement setting, the general public also plays a role in identifying suspects by recognizing suspicious behavior. The task of counter terrorism lies with entities at all levels. </small>
