<small> The fight between the massive Imperial beach pollution and Trumps $6 Billion border Wall</small>

<small>   After the bracero program in the 1960’s maquiladoras or export assembly plants have been the cornerstones of Mexico’s strategy to attract direct investment and boost exports. Due to the opportunity cost of higher profits and corporate greed, economics has replaced ethics on the rise of social and environmental issues. The purpose of the maquiladoras was to absorb many of the Mexican workers returning from the United States. The very existence of maquiladoras till this day is associated with the “pull theory”  and idea of special economic zones that offer advantages business conditions. These special economic zones attract investors, increase employment, and stimulate exports, all of which stimulates economic growth in a given area. However, many Americans and Mexican residents have been living in poor conditions and environments with minimum national level addressing the pollution and toxins from the maquiladoras causing “aguas negras”, inadequate drainage sewer system for maquiladoras, residential protest and government ignorance in the surrounding areas. </small>

<small>
 The ambience of maquiladoras around the border of Mexico releases uncontrollable air and water pollutions affecting the health on both sides of the border in order to avoid expensive U.S environmental requirements.  Mexico has tried to lure foreign investment into the country through a series of trade customs and economic policies in order to increase gross domestic product (GDP), employment and exportation.  In the early 1980’s, many U.S businesses were feeling inflexible from their Asian competitors and had decided that in order to remain in business, lower labor costs were necessary. </small>

<small>
Environmental organization have addressed serious pollution and resource management problems in Mexico as well as the United States, from Imperial Beach to Matamoros caused from Maquiladoras. In the United States, funding cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have prevented improvements to the Borderlands sewage system. </small>


<small> The United States EPA database shows that 2,153 maquiladoras are producing hazardous waste and are not regulated and/or maintained by the Mexican government . “President Trump’s proposal of a $25 billion border wall resulted on eliminating funding for the most important Environmental Protection Agency grant program used to construct environmental infrastructures along the U.S.-Mexico border including Tijuana”.  As a result, a longstanding humanitarian crisis is going unaddressed along the nation’ southern border – home to some 14 million people.  </small>

<small> Tijuana's workforce has a history of highly skilled manufacturing positions that have been established for over 40 years. Maquiladoras took this opportunity to pay minimum wage and give poor working conditions to employees for a high revenue return. Approximately 3,000 maquiladoras operate in free trade zones in Mexico, employing approximately 1.5 million people (CNIMME). The mean wages for employees is as little as $2.90 a day, and with soaring consumer prices that is not enough to maintain a family. Drinking water supplies and irrigation waters are being polluted and wildlife face extinction from the toxic waste dumped in rivers and lakes. Workplace hazards such as toxic chemicals, unsafe equipment, excessive heat and cold, etc. cause a wide range of health problems. Serious conditions such as sterility, seizures, organ failure and cancer may develop slowly, and sometimes lead to death. Mexican workers are frequently denied basic health and safety protection against occupational illness or disease, and they risk the loss of their jobs if they protest these dangerous conditions. For instance in 1997, the “Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Mexican Secretariat of Health, and border health officials began the development of the Border Infectious Disease Surveillance (BIRDS) project, a surveillance system for infectious diseases along the U.S.-Mexico border .” Due to maquilas high profitability and employment opportunities along the border, it  has generated a wave of migration from other regions of Mexico and Central America toward the poorest areas with poor environmental conditions. “Analysis of data from the U.S. National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System for 1990 through 1998 showed increased risks for certain foodborne, waterbone, an vaccine-preventable diseases in U.S. countries within 100 kilometer of the border, compared with non-border states.”

<small> Maquiladoras mainly produce cars, electronic equipment and clothing, which consume huge volumes of water, generate hazardous waste products like alcohols, benzene, acetone, acids, and plastic and metal debris, and emit polluting gasses.  Maquiladoras benefits from Mexico’s low wages, tax exemptions for imports, and flexible labor laws, which in return provides jobs causing significant environmental damages. The Environmental Health Coalition (EHC) states, “Mexico cannon afford regulate this sector adequately; we lack methods for solving these issues. Investment in clean technology reduces the profit margin, but we know that it is more expensive to remediate pollution.” So what improvements can United States or Mexico provide for employees and the environment?</small>

<small> The cost of cleaning up industrial and bacterial contaminants is skyrocketing. NAFTA includes “provisions on labor conditions and environmental protection, but there have not been enforced with sufficient rigour to correct harmful employment and environmental practices”  .  But the impact on waste has been a crisis and hasn’t really been regulated. The Environmental Health Coalition (EHC) program succeeded in 2004 forcing the Mexican government to clean up an abandoned factory where over 23,000 tons of waste was warehoused. This action led many companies to recycle materials and treat their liquid waste, but these “measures have not completely achieved the greening of the maquiladoras. ” The pollutant release and Transfer Registry (RETC), a department of Mexico’s environmental ministry, reported in 2007 that 212 million tons of pollutants were released into the environment, 99 percent of them into the atmosphere. This year the RETC aims to monitor 267 pollutants. Mexico’s federal agency for environmental protection is promoting clean industry certification but it has been going slow. </small>

<small>  Violation of workers’ rights and threats to their health are staggering in maquiladoras. The Mexican and U.S. governments drew up a collaborative environmental health program known as Border 2012, aiming at reducing soil, air and water pollution, improving environmental health and ensuring emergency preparedness along the Mexico-U.S. border. However, the only solution to slow down the environmental and social injustice is to have strong leaders and examples to grow an organization and educate workers, students, environmentalist and others to make an impact.</small>


<small> Mexico's problems are American problems, and we can see them today in a small southern beach town in San Diego known as Imperial Beach where contaminated water from Tijuana flows into our waters. Both cities on opposite sides of the border are aware of this ongoing situation and have coined these waters “aguas negras”, which is the literal translation of “black waters”.  Because wastewater disposal system often designed to treat only residential wastes in Tijuana, it results in a heavy and potentially hazardous burden from maquiladoras. “These industries typically involve metal plating, electronic, computer and transportation manufacturing and utilize toxics and heavy metals such as arsenic and lead.”  Lacking any industrial pretreatment program, Tijuana factories discharge these wastes into the overburdened sewage systems where they mix with residential waste. When the black waters overflow the collection system, they wind up in the Tijuana River watershed and on California’s beaches such as Imperial Beach. </small>

<small> 
Tijuana’s sewage system has an estimate of 6 to 7 millions gallons per day flowing into the Tijuana River Valley and into the Pacific Ocean. The cause of these massive sewage repulsions comes from a refusal with the international Boundary Water “Commission to obey the United States’ clean water protection laws and not taking responsibility to protect the Tijuana River, the Pacific Ocean and our community in San Diego and other borders cities”.  These tens of millions of gallons of untreated sewage have poured through our community threatening the health, safety, and economy of Imperial Beach and surrounding communities. </small>

<small> Indeed, our current politics in the United States is plagued with the idea that we need a $5.7 billion border wall that separates the Mexican border from ours to keep the “bad hombres” away. However, this solution to the border crisis of illegal aliens entering our borders is only a diversion of the real issue at hand, which is that Americans have contributed largely to the Mexican pollution of their waters which has now seeped into our side of the border affecting thousands of residents in San Diego. Since taking office, President Donald Trump has given a voice to those who argue for a border wall, thus silencing those who are truly affected on a local level making those residents take matters into their own hands. </small>

<small>Threatening the health, safety, and economy of Imperial Beach and surrounding communities, residents have joined with the Unified Port District of San Diego and the City of Chula Vista to have annual water quality meetings and daily water testing .  Although these solutions offered by the residents affected by the “aguas negras” may not last for years to come, they are doing more than what the President of the United States is doing for his people. </small>
