People usually get discourage at the gym when they see no improvements whatsoever. These factors can be lack of sleep, vitamins, protein, carbs, fat intake or even your workout program. If you don’t eat enough, your body can’t use calories for repair and growth.  As a rule of thumb, weight loss is generally 75 percent diet and 25 percent exercise. 

In recent years, much attention has been paid to the search of natural substances in foods that can be
benecial to the human body in preventing or treating one or more diseases or improving its physiological
performance.This research has been taken from the University of California Database and UCSB athletes. This are our recommendations for a faster and healthy aesthetic body. 


## Creatine Monohydrate 

<p><small>Creatine (N-[aminoiminomethyl]-N-methyl glycine, Cr) is a nonessential dietary element
found in high abundance in meat and fish. Currently, Cr is widely used as an ergogenic nutritional supplement
by athletes, and it is well tolerated in this specic sector of consumers. It has been estimated that
more than one-third of athletes regularly use Cr to improve muscular performance. On the other hand,
recent  findings have indicated that Cr supplementation has a therapeutic role in preventing several diseases
characterized by atrophic conditions, weakness, and metabolic disturbances. Thus, Cr is an emerging
nutritional supplement used not only by athletes, but also by elderly people as well as aged patients
presenting different diseases. </small></p>

<b>Note:</b>
> The ingestion of Cr together with other food supplements can promote and enhance its effect as ergogenic
dietary complement. It has been described that the ingestion of carbohydrate with Cr enhances intramuscular Cr uptake and glycogen deposition (Green et¡al. 1996a,b), whereas ingestion of glucose
and sodium with Cr would theoretically provide additional ergogenic effect.
